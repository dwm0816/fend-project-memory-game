##Personal notes
Due to some minor technical issues and general business I did not take full advantage of git during this project. I will be working on
my git habits in my free time from now on. 

After there is no longer a deadline I will be continuin with this project. I have several features I'd like to add.

##Changes to be made
Minifying the code is a major need at this stage. A bit of formatting is also needed for readability. 
I will make these changes as time allows.
