<h2>What is this?</h2>

<h2>Personal notes</h2>
Due to some minor technical issues and general business I did not take full advantage of git during this project. I will be working on
my git habits in my free time from now on. 

After there is no longer a deadline I will be continuin with this project. I have several features I'd like to add.

<h2>Changes to be made</h2>
Minifying the code is a major need at this stage. A bit of formatting is also needed for readability. 
I will make these changes as time allows.
